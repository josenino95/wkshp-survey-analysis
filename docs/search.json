Perhaps the workbook and course flow should be reorganized. Or having a cheatsheet available of commands we have learned so far so participants don’t have to scroll through the workbook endlessly when trying to solve a challenge. I think a fully online course would work much better (since I can’t attend in person, but grateful to have access to these courses working remotely, so I’ll take whatever you can swing!). One of the instructors shell was color coded, which was sooo much easier to follow along even though its not what my own shell looks like. Maybe multiple shell windows up at the same time so when working in nano the previous commands are still available for those who are a step or two behind. I think it would be great to emphasize somewhere in the course why command line is still important when working on modern computers. Looking forward to the next course, thanks!"

It’s kinda hot and stuffy inside the room.\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nmaking sure that they are familiar with the lesson and exactly what they are going to show and that there aren’t any issues before they lead the lesson. When the instructors got confused or made mistakes and had to try to fix them, it made learning already confusing things even more confusing because I was lost on what was a mistake and what was correct. In general, I believe it went a little too fast for me\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nNot jumping around directories quickly\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nBetter coordination between instructors if other instructors need to interrupt the instructor currently teaching to better explain a point or answer a question\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nClearer syllabus and more exercises\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nBreak time can come a little soon.\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\ngrep gets a little complicated with escape characters, I think those could be added to the workshop\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nnone\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nsharing instructors use for bash-shell and participants briefly sharing relevance to their own work (I mostly work in rstudio on datasets, or morphing datasets into better datasets, I rarely work with tons of files…)\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nI found it particularly difficult to follow along in this hybrid course. Perhaps the workbook and course flow should be reorganized. Or having a cheatsheet available of commands we have learned so far so participants don’t have to scroll through the workbook endlessly when trying to solve a challenge. I think a fully online course would work much better (since I can’t attend in person, but grateful to have access to these courses working remotely, so I’ll take whatever you can swing!). One of the instructors shell was color coded, which was sooo much easier to follow along even though its not what my own shell looks like. Maybe multiple shell windows up at the same time so when working in nano the previous commands are still available for those who are a step or two behind. I think it would be great to emphasize somewhere in the course why command line is still important when working on modern computers. Looking forward to the next course, thanks!\n\n\n2022-07-19-ucsb-git\nGreat workshop but it might help if the instructors do not go too fast sometimes since we need to execute commands. Thank you!\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nIt would be super helpful if there was an additional day allotted to this workshop as we were unable to cover everything as planned.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\n’- There were a few uncertainties in the material taught on the 2nd day; - Some parts of the workshop were a bit fast paced; - There were a few technical difficulties on zoom in the beginning (but they were resolved in the end);\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nEverything was good. thank you.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nPerhaps providing the scripts ahead or time or afterward so that we can re-do the lessons at our leisure after the workshop.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nwould have liked to learn how to import data (e.g., from csv files, etc) to work with.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nI think some of the instructors that are not teaching at the moment should be monitoring the room a bit more. I was stuck and put up my pink sticky note, but didn’t get help until the break.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nn/a;\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nNot all instructors had a strong grasp on R, which caused some slow-downs and also caused some confusing presentation of the material. ; ; It would also be useful if the instructors presented clear and self-constrained scripts in these lessons (i.e. how one would actually organize scripts in their own work). This was done inconsistently across trainers, and there were some errors in how the scripts were managed. For example, it would be useful to tell the learners that it is important to clear your environment between scripts and to make sure that objects referenced only in previous scripts are not used in your current script.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nN/A\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nbetter timing - although instructor commented that they rarely get through the whole thing; or plan more realistic timing goals\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nAs someone fairly new to R, perhaps a longer class (more days) to go through the lessons slower, step by step. I can do this on my own now, but it would have been nice to have more time to learn the steps. Sometimes I would have an error in my typing that took me awhile to catch and fix and by then the workshop had moved on. I was usually able to catch up or fix it later by redoing the lesson in my own timeframe.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nincluding a quick tutorial video on the set-up page for how to get the data up n running before may help alleviate some of the issues that required troubleshooting at the beginning of the workshop\n\n\n2022-08-16-ucsb-machlearn-r\nit’s always a struggle, especially in piloted workshops, to have a good balance between getting through the planned material and allowing enough time in the workshops to provide necessary background/context info and answer questions. The first day was paced a bit fast, but we made it through the material; the second day accommodated more time for explanations, but we did not make it through the material."

Perhaps the workbook and course flow should be reorganized. Or having a cheatsheet available of commands we have learned so far so participants don’t have to scroll through the workbook endlessly when trying to solve a challenge. I think a fully online course would work much better (since I can’t attend in person, but grateful to have access to these courses working remotely, so I’ll take whatever you can swing!). One of the instructors shell was color coded, which was sooo much easier to follow along even though its not what my own shell looks like. Maybe multiple shell windows up at the same time so when working in nano the previous commands are still available for those who are a step or two behind. I think it would be great to emphasize somewhere in the course why command line is still important when working on modern computers. Looking forward to the next course, thanks!\n\n\n2022-07-19-ucsb-git\nGreat workshop but it might help if the instructors do not go too fast sometimes since we need to execute commands. Thank you!\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nIt would be super helpful if there was an additional day allotted to this workshop as we were unable to cover everything as planned.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\n’- There were a few uncertainties in the material taught on the 2nd day; - Some parts of the workshop were a bit fast paced; - There were a few technical difficulties on zoom in the beginning (but they were resolved in the end);\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nEverything was good. thank you.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nPerhaps providing the scripts ahead or time or afterward so that we can re-do the lessons at our leisure after the workshop.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nwould have liked to learn how to import data (e.g., from csv files, etc) to work with.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nI think some of the instructors that are not teaching at the moment should be monitoring the room a bit more. I was stuck and put up my pink sticky note, but didn’t get help until the break.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nn/a;\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nNot all instructors had a strong grasp on R, which caused some slow-downs and also caused some confusing presentation of the material. ; ; It would also be useful if the instructors presented clear and self-constrained scripts in these lessons (i.e. how one would actually organize scripts in their own work). This was done inconsistently across trainers, and there were some errors in how the scripts were managed. For example, it would be useful to tell the learners that it is important to clear your environment between scripts and to make sure that objects referenced only in previous scripts are not used in your current script.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nN/A\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nbetter timing - although instructor commented that they rarely get through the whole thing; or plan more realistic timing goals\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nAs someone fairly new to R, perhaps a longer class (more days) to go through the lessons slower, step by step. I can do this on my own now, but it would have been nice to have more time to learn the steps. Sometimes I would have an error in my typing that took me awhile to catch and fix and by then the workshop had moved on. I was usually able to catch up or fix it later by redoing the lesson in my own timeframe.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nincluding a quick tutorial video on the set-up page for how to get the data up n running before may help alleviate some of the issues that required troubleshooting at the beginning of the workshop\n\n\n2022-08-16-ucsb-machlearn-r\nit’s always a struggle, especially in piloted workshops, to have a good balance between getting through the planned material and allowing enough time in the workshops to provide necessary background/context info and answer questions. The first day was paced a bit fast, but we made it through the material; the second day accommodated more time for explanations, but we did not make it through the material."

There were a few times where the instructors broke down the code, explaining what each piece did and that was AWESOME! I wish the whole class would’ve been like that. But most of the time, it was like just watching somebody code. I had no idea why they were typing the things they were typing. I felt like a monkey, just typing whatever the instructors typed with 0% understanding of why I was typing it.\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nI wish there had been a little more challenges in class. Or, it might be a good idea to assign a challenge as homework.\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nIt was unclear where to find the reading materials and learning module and that we are expected to keep up with those materials. There was no following along between the in-class learning and what was in the reading materials on the site because it was never referenced (we’re now on page ‘blah’).\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nAt times it was difficult to follow and I wasn’t always sure how I could apply what I learned to my work after the workshop. Or why we were learning the particular things we were working on in the course. ; ; ; Since this course is a “data analysis and visualization” class I think it would be best to have the workshop follow a small project. Get some datasets where the population is people instead of animals. And, work together to answer a very simple but specific research question throughout the course and generate some graphs at the end.\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nI think less time reviewing the previous weeks material would improve the workshop\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nslower at some points\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nWe lost time in all sessions because people were lost on where they had organized their files, so maybe thinking of a more general and accessible way to managing folders and files can be useful\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nWe lost time in all sessions because people were lost on where they had organized their files, so maybe thinking of a more general and accessible way to managing folders and files can be useful\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nMaybe applied into a single project so there’s one thread of logic (instead of broken up into chunks).

There were a few times where the instructors broke down the code, explaining what each piece did and that was AWESOME! I wish the whole class would’ve been like that.

Or why we were learning the particular things we were working on in the course. ; ; ; Since this course is a “data analysis and visualization” class I think it would be best to have the workshop follow a small project. Get some datasets where the population is people instead of animals. And, work together to answer a very simple but specific research question throughout the course and generate some graphs at the end.\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nI think less time reviewing the previous weeks material would improve the workshop\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nslower at some points\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nWe lost time in all sessions because people were lost on where they had organized their files, so maybe thinking of a more general and accessible way to managing folders and files can be useful\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nWe lost time in all sessions because people were lost on where they had organized their files, so maybe thinking of a more general and accessible way to managing folders and files can be useful\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nMaybe applied into a single project so there’s one thread of logic (instead of broken up into chunks).

Get some datasets where the population is people instead of animals. And, work together to answer a very simple but specific research question throughout the course and generate some graphs at the end.\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nI think less time reviewing the previous weeks material would improve the workshop\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nslower at some points\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nWe lost time in all sessions because people were lost on where they had organized their files, so maybe thinking of a more general and accessible way to managing folders and files can be useful\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nWe lost time in all sessions because people were lost on where they had organized their files, so maybe thinking of a more general and accessible way to managing folders and files can be useful\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nMaybe applied into a single project so there’s one thread of logic (instead of broken up into chunks).

I mention this because I think the topic of version control can be very confusing to newcomers. For people who are brand new to the whole topic, who I believe would be the target audience, I think it might be helpful to spend more time at the beginning going over what version control is about and the benefits of using it. You already do this, but I would expand out on it.\n\n\n2024-01-30-ucsb-git\nMake it more clear what programs need to be downloaded and installed prior to the workshop.\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nMaybe go over more examples of how webscraping can be used in research settings.\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nmake it really introductory?

Even if there’s no time to demo starting with something that we’d actually want to apply, then walking the more complex topic back would have been more useful."

Tough if you don’t really know the HTML terminology.\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nLearned a lot of new information, taught in a way that was easy and accessible.\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nI’m sorry I can’t think of any right now - I feel like I would have been just as well served with a link to the tool and a web tutorial."

I mention this because I think the topic of version control can be very confusing to newcomers. For people who are brand new to the whole topic, who I believe would be the target audience, I think it might be helpful to spend more time at the beginning going over what version control is about and the benefits of using it. You already do this, but I would expand out on it.\n\n\n2024-01-30-ucsb-git\nMake it more clear what programs need to be downloaded and installed prior to the workshop.\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nMaybe go over more examples of how webscraping can be used in research settings.\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nmake it really introductory? Persuade me that scraping a web site is quicker and faster than just copying it and pasting it into excel or word and then extracting what I want. Don’t assume I know what you mean by an “anchor.”\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nBetter explanation of possible uses for these tools\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nIt felt like the XPath instructor didn’t know much about the Scraper tool, but I think that doesn’t necessarily need to be resolved more even knowledge of the entire workshop maybe\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nI understand starting us with the basics but talking us through or referring us to how it could be built into something more complex is a loop I was expecting to see completed but never came about. Even if there’s no time to demo starting with something that we’d actually want to apply, then walking the more complex topic back would have been more useful."
